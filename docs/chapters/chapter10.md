## App Challenge Part 4 - EXTRA BONUS TIME

Have you completed all requirements of the app challenge and still have time left? Good news! There’s still more fun to be had.

Take whatever time you have left and implement a new feature for FurFriendster. Use your imagination! What feature does the best pet finding app on the market really need?

If you’re having trouble coming up with good ideas, we have a few suggestions.

* Adding favorites
    * Allow users to heart or start their favorite pets, and show those favorites in a new screen in your app.
* A new theme
    * Try a different [color scheme](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme#color-schemes) to give your app a whole new look.
* Random pet
    * Give the user a way of seeing for a random pet.
