## App Challenges

Welcome to App Challenges. Here you will build out a "real" app.

### Prerequisites

All attendees must have completed the NativeScript Workshop or an equivalent getting started course.
They must have the NativeScript CLI installed, and all system requirements in place to develop for _either_ iOS or Android. If you haven’t already, complete the installation instructions using the link below.

* [Complete the NativeScript installation guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.html)

> **TIP**: If you run into issues completing the setup instructions, try [joining the NativeScript Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation) and asking questions in the #getting-started channel.

Additionally, please also [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and then [install the editor’s NativeScript extension](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/visual-studio-code-extension#installation). You’ll be using NativeScript’s Visual Studio Code extension as you complete this guide.
